# Designit Makey Go
--------------------

This project was initially designed for Designit's prototyping workshops at [Designit Lab](http://designitstockholmlab.tumblr.com/).

The circuit and firmware inspired on [Makey Makey Go](http://designitstockholmlab.tumblr.com/) and developed on top of Arduino micro using the [Capacitive Sensor Library]().

The shcematics, look more or less like this, except by the inductors (coils) are just jumpers and the pin numbers are not exactly the same:
