# Designit Makey Go
This project was initially inspired by [Makey Makey Go](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joylabz/makey-makey-go-invent-everywhere-invent-now) and designed for Designit's prototyping workshops at [Designit Lab](http://designitstockholmlab.tumblr.com/) and used later on for prototyping lectures at Berghs School of Communication.

## Previous version
The first circuit and firmware were inspired on [Makey Makey Go](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joylabz/makey-makey-go-invent-everywhere-invent-now) and developed on top of Arduino micro using the [Capacitive Sensor Library]().

## Current version
The current version is an optimized and minimalistic version that doesn't require any resistors. Big thanks to [Paulo Barcelos' DYIMakeyGo](https://github.com/paulobarcelos/DIYMakeyGo) for his amazing solution!

(there is no need anymore for the resistors)

The current setup provides 4 inputs:
- Mouse left click: Orange / Pin 9
- Space bar: Yellow / Pin 8
- Left arrow: White / Pin 7
- Right arrow: Blue / Pin 6
